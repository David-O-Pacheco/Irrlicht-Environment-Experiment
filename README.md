# Irrlicht-Environment-Experiment

#### Start Date: 10/2017

#### Description: A 3D scene rendered using C++ and Irrlicht Library. The implementation of performance enhancers/mechanics were necessary in order for the scene to run at 60 frames per second. One of those performance mechanics works as follows; If the player is a certain distance away from a building, the 3D model will stop rendering and a billboard will take it's place.
